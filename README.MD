This repo features several Jupyter notebooks that I use as CLI wrappers.  
They can also be used in VS Code with Jupyter/Polyglot Notebooks extensions.  
Instaling Jupyter is not required for VS Code use.  

## The benefits of using notebooks as CLI wrappers:  
\- Commands can be called with one click  
\- Frequently used commands can easily be added and saved for later use  
\- No walls of text in the Terminal. Output from each command stays under its cell and get updated on each run.  
\- Command outputs stay in the notebook when saved for future reference
