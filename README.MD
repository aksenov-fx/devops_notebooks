This repo features several Jupyter notebooks that I use as CLI wrappers.  
They can also be used in VS Code with Jupyter/Polyglot Notebooks extensions.  
Instaling Jupyter is not required for VS Code use.  

## The benefits of using notebooks as CLI wrappers:  
\- Commands can be executed with one click  
\- Frequently used commands are saved for later use
\- No Terminal cluttering. Output for each command stays under its cell and gets updated on each run.
